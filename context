to be honest, probably not as it's doing the copy inside qxcontroller and the object is a derived class from another object. 
Summarising, I'm doing a dereference (using .get()) of a AncillaryCollectorPacket that lives in AncillaryTypes.h, and then copying it using
 
AncillaryTypes::AncillaryCollectorPacket* rawPointer = ancData.get();
std::unique_ptr<AncillaryTypes::AncillaryCollectorPacket> copiedPacket (new AncillaryTypes::AncillaryCollectorPacket (*rawPointer));

it's taking 0.5 to 1ms to do the dereference - is that a lot?
